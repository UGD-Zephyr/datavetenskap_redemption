Date: 2022-10-09

This was the third and last exercise to complete when I was
studying for computer science in university. 
We had a pre-made list of various "made up" people and their
various data. Height, Weight, age, name and so forth.

Display relevant persons data by searching for it through
the program. For example: "find everyone with the age 34"

- Pre-made .txt file with data about people
- Have a struct contain all the data
