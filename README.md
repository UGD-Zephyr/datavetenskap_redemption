# Datavetenskap Redemption

Once upon a time I was a computer science dropout.
This repository will be my redemption.

I will complete the programming assignments I was
given all those years ago and COMPLETE them!

- The first one is a Celsius / Fahrentheit converter
- The second one is something with arrays...don't quite remember yet..
- The third one is a .txt file with data on people. Names, age, work
  where you also can search for any one, individual data and get all
  corresponding data as well.
